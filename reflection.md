#What we learned
We learned the basic code of python and how to create variables and how to write code so that when that variable in in action, the robot will do what we want it do do. We also learned how to create if, else if, and when true statements. Another important thing we learned was how to understand what error code meant and how to fix it. 
#What worked well
What worked well is that we were able to create code so that when a button was pressed the robot either went forward, turned to the side, or lowered/raised the painting brush. 
#What we would do differently
We tried to make it so that when the button was pressed one time it would do the action automated, but for some reason that code did not work for the driving, even though it worked for lowering and raising the paintbrush. Our robot is not fully automated because this did not work.
